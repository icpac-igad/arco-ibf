# Development Iterations and Problem-Solving Journey

## Overview

This document chronicles the complete development journey, including all iterations, challenges encountered, solutions implemented, and lessons learned during the TiTiler-PgSTAC deployment on Replit.

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and GDAL Challenges

### Iteration 1.1: Standard Installation Attempt
**Goal**: Install TiTiler-PgSTAC using standard Python packaging
**Approach**: Direct pip installation of titiler-pgstac
**Challenges Encountered**:
- GDAL dependency conflicts
- System library requirements not available on Replit
- Compilation failures for geospatial libraries

**Error Examples**:
```bash
ERROR: Failed building wheel for GDAL
Could not find gdal-config. Make sure you have installed the GDAL native library
```

**Resolution**: Abandoned standard installation, moved to custom wheel approach

### Iteration 1.2: System Package Installation
**Goal**: Install GDAL via system package manager
**Approach**: Using apt-get for system dependencies
**Challenges**:
- Limited system access on Replit
- Package conflicts with existing libraries
- Version compatibility issues

**Code Attempts**:
```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y gdal-bin libgdal-dev
# Failed due to permission restrictions
```

**Resolution**: Discovered Replit's system limitations, pivoted to wheel-based approach

### Iteration 1.3: Unofficial GDAL Wheels Solution
**Goal**: Bypass system dependencies entirely
**Approach**: Pre-compiled wheels from unofficial repository
**Implementation**:
```python
def install_gdal_wheel():
    gdal_wheel = "https://github.com/cgohlke/geospatial-wheels/releases/download/v2023.10.20/GDAL-3.8.0-cp311-cp311-linux_x86_64.whl"
    subprocess.run([sys.executable, "-m", "pip", "install", gdal_wheel, "--force-reinstall", "--no-deps"], check=True)
```

**Success Metrics**:
- GDAL 3.8.0 successfully installed
- Rasterio integration working
- All geospatial operations functional

## Phase 2: Database Architecture Evolution

### Iteration 2.1: Replit PostgreSQL Integration
**Goal**: Use Replit's built-in PostgreSQL database
**Approach**: Local database setup with PostGIS extensions
**Challenges**:
- Resource conflicts between GDAL and PostgreSQL setup
- Limited database administration capabilities
- Performance constraints in shared environment

**Database Setup Attempts**:
```python
def setup_local_postgres():
    # Attempted to configure PostgreSQL extensions locally
    # Failed due to system dependency conflicts
```

**Resolution**: Recognized need for external database solution

### Iteration 2.2: External Database Evaluation
**Goal**: Identify suitable managed PostgreSQL service
**Evaluation Criteria**:
- PostGIS extension support
- pgSTAC compatibility
- Connection reliability from Replit
- Cost effectiveness for development

**Services Evaluated**:
- Neon Database (selected)
- AWS RDS PostgreSQL
- Google Cloud SQL
- Supabase

**Selection Rationale**: Neon provided optimal balance of features, performance, and ease of setup

### Iteration 2.3: Neon Database Implementation
**Goal**: Full integration with external PostgreSQL service
**Implementation Steps**:
1. Database creation and configuration
2. Extension installation (PostGIS, pgSTAC)
3. Connection pool optimization
4. Performance tuning

**Connection Configuration**:
```python
DATABASE_CONFIG = {
    "pool_size": 10,
    "max_overflow": 20,
    "pool_pre_ping": True,
    "pool_recycle": 3600,
    "connect_args": {
        "sslmode": "require",
        "connect_timeout": 10
    }
}
```

**Results**:
- Stable database connectivity
- Proper pgSTAC schema deployment
- Optimized query performance

## Phase 3: Proxy Architecture Development

### Iteration 3.1: Direct TiTiler Deployment
**Goal**: Run TiTiler directly on Replit's hosting
**Approach**: Standard FastAPI application deployment
**Issues Discovered**:
- HTTP URL generation in HTTPS environment
- Mixed content warnings in browsers
- Tile loading failures due to protocol mismatch

**Example Problem**:
```json
{
  "tile_url": "http://titiler-pgstac.username.replit.dev/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}",
  "expected": "https://titiler-pgstac.username.replit.dev/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}"
}
```

### Iteration 3.2: URL Generation Fixes
**Goal**: Force HTTPS URL generation in TiTiler
**Approaches Attempted**:
1. Environment variable configuration
2. FastAPI root_path configuration
3. Custom URL generation middleware

**Code Examples**:
```python
# Attempted solution 1: Environment variables
os.environ["FORWARDED_ALLOW_IPS"] = "*"
os.environ["PROXY_HEADERS_MODE"] = "trusted"

# Attempted solution 2: FastAPI configuration
app = FastAPI(root_path="/", openapi_prefix="https")

# Attempted solution 3: Middleware
@app.middleware("http")
async def force_https_urls(request: Request, call_next):
    # Various header manipulation attempts
```

**Results**: Partial success, but inconsistent URL generation

### Iteration 3.3: Nginx Reverse Proxy Solution
**Goal**: Implement proper proxy architecture for HTTPS handling
**Architecture Design**:
- Nginx as reverse proxy (port 8000)
- TiTiler backend (port 8001)
- Proper header forwarding for URL generation

**Nginx Configuration Development**:
```nginx
# Initial basic configuration
server {
    listen 8000;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8001;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
    }
}
```

**Iterations on Configuration**:
1. Basic proxy setup
2. Header forwarding optimization
3. Performance tuning (caching, compression)
4. Error handling and monitoring

### Iteration 3.4: Service Orchestration
**Goal**: Manage multiple services (Nginx + TiTiler) reliably
**Challenges**:
- Process lifecycle management
- Startup sequencing
- Health monitoring
- Graceful shutdown

**Service Manager Evolution**:
```python
# Version 1: Basic process spawning
def start_services():
    nginx_proc = subprocess.Popen(["nginx"])
    titiler_proc = subprocess.Popen(["uvicorn", "main:app"])

# Version 2: Proper lifecycle management
class ServiceManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.processes = []
        signal.signal(signal.SIGINT, self.cleanup)
    
    def start_service(self, cmd):
        process = subprocess.Popen(cmd)
        self.processes.append(process)
        return process
    
    def cleanup(self):
        for process in self.processes:
            process.terminate()
            process.wait()
```

**Final Implementation**: Comprehensive service orchestration with logging, health checks, and proper cleanup

## Phase 4: Architecture Refinement

### Iteration 4.1: TiTiler-PgSTAC vs TiTiler.Xarray
**Challenge**: Supporting both STAC data and multidimensional datasets
**Initial Approach**: Pure TiTiler-PgSTAC implementation
**Evolution**: Hybrid approach supporting both architectures

**Architecture Decision Matrix**:
| Use Case | Technology | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| STAC Collections | TiTiler-PgSTAC | Optimized for STAC metadata |
| Zarr/NetCDF | TiTiler.Xarray | Native multidimensional support |
| COG Files | Both | Format flexibility |

### Iteration 4.2: Endpoint Structure Design
**Goal**: Provide consistent API interface for different data types
**Design Evolution**:

**Version 1**: Separate applications
```python
# Separate FastAPI apps for different purposes
pgstac_app = FastAPI(title="TiTiler-PgSTAC")
xarray_app = FastAPI(title="TiTiler-Xarray")
```

**Version 2**: Unified application with routing
```python
# Single app with intelligent routing
@app.get("/collections/{collection_id}/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}")
async def get_tile_pgstac():
    # Route to pgSTAC handler
    
@app.get("/md/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}")  
async def get_tile_xarray():
    # Route to xarray handler
```

**Final Architecture**: Modular design supporting both paradigms with clear endpoint separation

### Iteration 4.3: Data Source Integration
**Goal**: Connect to authentic geospatial data sources
**Data Sources Evaluated**:
1. NOAA GEFS (Global Ensemble Forecast System)
2. Sentinel-2 imagery
3. Landsat collections
4. Custom STAC catalogs

**NOAA GEFS Integration**:
```python
NOAA_GEFS_URL = "https://noaa-gefs-pds.s3.amazonaws.com/gefs.20240101/00/atmos_pgrb2ap5/gefs.t00z.pgrb2a.0p50.f000"

@app.get("/test/noaa-dataset")
async def test_noaa_dataset():
    dataset = xarray.open_dataset(NOAA_GEFS_URL, engine='cfgrib')
    return {
        "variables": list(dataset.variables.keys()),
        "dimensions": dict(dataset.dims),
        "coordinates": list(dataset.coords.keys())
    }
```

**Success Metrics**:

        "memory_usage": get_memory_usage(),
        "active_connections": get_connection_count()
    }
```

## Phase 6: Replit Configuration and Deployment

### Iteration 6.1: Replit Configuration File
