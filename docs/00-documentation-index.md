## Development Timeline Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (GDAL Installation)
**Challenge**: Installing geospatial libraries on Replit's restricted environment
**Solution**: Custom wheel-based installation bypassing system dependencies
**Outcome**: Successful GDAL 3.8+ installation with full functionality

### Phase 2: Data Architecture (Database Setup)
**Challenge**: PostgreSQL conflicts with GDAL installation
**Solution**: External Neon database with optimized connection pooling
**Outcome**: Reliable pgSTAC backend with PostGIS extensions

### Phase 3: Service Architecture (Reverse Proxy)
**Challenge**: HTTP URL generation in HTTPS environment
**Solution**: Nginx reverse proxy with proper header forwarding
**Outcome**: Correct HTTPS URL generation and performance optimization

### Phase 4: Application Development (TiTiler Integration)
**Challenge**: Supporting both STAC and multidimensional datasets
**Solution**: Hybrid architecture with TiTiler-PgSTAC and TiTiler.Xarray
**Outcome**: Comprehensive geospatial tile server with multiple data format support

### Phase 5: Production Readiness (Testing & Optimization)
**Challenge**: Ensuring reliability and performance for production use
**Solution**: Comprehensive testing suite and monitoring framework
**Outcome**: Production-ready deployment with health checks and performance metrics

## Usage Patterns

### Development Workflow
1. Read [Project Overview](01-project-overview.md) for architecture understanding
2. Follow [GDAL Installation](02-gdal-installation.md) for dependency setup
3. Configure database using [Database Setup](03-database-setup.md)
4. Implement proxy following [Reverse Proxy Setup](04-reverse-proxy-setup.md)
5. Validate using [Testing Procedures](06-testing-procedures.md)

### Deployment Workflow
1. Use `create_minimal_deployment.py` to generate clean deployment
2. Deploy minimal files to production environment
3. Configure environment variables for database connection
4. Start services using production mode
5. Monitor health endpoints and performance metrics

### Troubleshooting Workflow
1. Check [Development Iterations](05-development-iterations.md) for similar issues
2. Run diagnostic tests from [Testing Procedures](06-testing-procedures.md)
3. Review specific component documentation for detailed guidance
4. Use health check endpoints for system status verification

## Best Practices Summary

### Installation
- Always install GDAL before other geospatial dependencies
- Use external database to avoid resource conflicts
- Implement proper environment variable configuration
- Test each component individually before integration

### Development
- Follow iterative approach with small, testable changes
- Implement comprehensive error handling and logging
- Use health checks and monitoring from the beginning
- Document all configuration decisions and rationale

### Deployment
- Use minimal file set for production deployments
- Implement proper service orchestration and lifecycle management
- Configure appropriate caching and performance optimizations
- Maintain comprehensive test coverage for all components
