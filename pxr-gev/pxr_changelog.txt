2.0.0
29 March 2019
- Use ERA5 data on the period 1979-2018.
- Based on the GEV distribution with a fixed shape parameter.
- Distribution parameters are estimated using the Probability-Weigthed moments.
- Goodness of fit assessed with both the Filliben and the Lilliefors tests.
- Uncertainty of the parameters (confidence interval) estimated with the bootstrap method with 1000 samples.
- Only the scaling parameters obtained from all the durations are considered (PXR-4 only).
