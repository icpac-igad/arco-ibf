## DevOps routines for Impact Based Forecasting based on Cloud Native Operations and ARCO

This repostiory contians Python based script to generate IBF based on workflow
as described in DOI:10.13140/RG.2.2.36634.41928. Majorly focusing on DevOPs priciples
to have operational generation of IBF considering the cloud computing infrasture and 
data format in ARCO for cost effective daily/weekly/monthly operational product for DRM. 

The repository will be organized in the forms of IBF workflow focusing on ARCO formats and CNO

1. events- routines for event based storylines and historical extreme values  
1. fcst- scripts to collect EPS forecast products
2. obs - scripts to collect observation products
3. haz - hazard model output, input datasets for flood and drought hydrological and hydrodynamic models
4. imp - impact modeling routine, exposure datasets, impact functions, climada based impact calcuation
5. verify - forecast verification routines 
5. bn - bayesian network based risk and deicision analysis routines to generate IBF risk matrices
